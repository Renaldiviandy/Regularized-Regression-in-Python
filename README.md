The features can be summarized as follows:

1. CRIM: This is the per capita crime rate by town

3. INDUS: This is the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. CHAS: This is the Charles River dummy variable (this is equal to 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX: This is the nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM: This is the average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE: This is the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS: This is the weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
9. RAD: This is the index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX: This is the full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
11. PTRATIO: This is the pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. BLACK: This is calculated as 1000(Bk — 0.63)², where Bk is the proportion of people of African American descent by town
13. LSTAT: This is the percentage lower status of the population
14. MEDV: This is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make use of the information provided in a dayly basis.
